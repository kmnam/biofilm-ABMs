A subset of the code in this repository was used to perform and analyze the simulations in:

J.-S.B. Tai, K.-M. Nam, C. Li, J. Nijjer, S. Zhang, C.M. Waters, J. Yan, [Single-cell imaging reveals spontaneous phenotypic sorting and bet-hedging in developing biofilms.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.03.657734v1) bioRxiv 2025.06.03.657734v1.
